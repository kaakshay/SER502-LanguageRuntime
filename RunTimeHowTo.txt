I have generated a .jar file for the runtime.
I have also placed a few intermediate code samples in SampleIC folder.

To run the jar, navigate to this directory and then run this command from the terminal

java -jar BlahRuntime.jar SampleIR/boolean.blah

Replace boolean.blah with your file name and SampleIR with directory of your choice.
Not giving a file name will run all my test cases in the SampleIR directory.
